This repository contains a simple implementation of a RESTful API using the Fiber framework in Go. The API allows CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee data stored in a MongoDB database. The API provides endpoints for retrieving all employees, creating a new employee, updating an existing employee, and deleting an employee by ID.
